# Crypto Monitor
This is an attempt at using AWS Serverless Application Model 
([SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/index.html)) to
deploy [Infura Monitoring](https://github.com/mattmcd/infura_monitoring) as AWS Lambda functions
with credentials stored in 
[AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html).

## Tooling
Development uses JetBrains PyCharm with 
[AWS Toolkit Plugin](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2018/11/aws-serverless-developer-experience-and-more/).
